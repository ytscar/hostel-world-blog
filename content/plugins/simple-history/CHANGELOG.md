### 4.17.0 (August 2024)

üêû This release contains some small bug fixes and enhancements. The [previous version](https://simple-history.com/2024/simple-history-4-16-0/?utm_source=wpadmin) had more cool new features so check out that one if you haven't already.

-   Tested on [WordPress 6.6](https://wordpress.org/news/2024/07/dorsey/).
-   Correct URL for "Go to Simple History" link on updated page on multisite.
-   Add `simple_history/log_query_inner_where_array` as a replacement for filter `simple_history/log_query_inner_where` that got removed in 4.9.0. The new filter is an array filter and can be used to add or modify the where clauses that the log query will use. See this [GitHub issue for some examples](https://github.com/bonny/WordPress-Simple-History/issues/455#issuecomment-2263206236).
-   Add link to Simple History below the "All updates have been completed" message for more cases (it was missing when translations was updated, for example).
-   Add filter `simple_history/show_action_link` that can be used to disable the link to the action that is shown in the log. This can be useful if you want to hide the link to the action for some users or in some cases. Example usage: `add_filter("simple_history/show_action_link", "__return_false");`.
-   Update Select2. [#456](https://github.com/bonny/WordPress-Simple-History/issues/456)

üåü Pssst.... Don't forget that you can [sponsor this project to keep it free and open source](https://simple-history.com/sponsor/). And if you need more features you can buy [add-ons that also get you some extra features](https://simple-history.com/add-ons/). üåü

**Added**

-   Debug page additions
    -   Display detected db engine to debug page. Can be useful for debugging since Simple History supports MySQL, MariaDB, and SQLite.
    -   Table size and number of rows for SQLite databases are shown on the debug page (they were already shown for MySQL and MariaDB).
    -   Display [Drop-ins](https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/functions/get_dropins/) on the debug page.
-   Throw exception if [log query](https://simple-history.com/docs/query-api/) has any db errors instead of just dying silently. This should help with debugging since the message often is visible in the log. [#438](https://github.com/bonny/WordPress-Simple-History/issues/438)
-   Plugin update failures are now logged, with error message added to context. This can happen when a plugin can't remove it's folder. [#345](https://github.com/bonny/WordPress-Simple-History/issues/345)

-   RSS feed support for filtering by loglevels ( e.g.,`?loglevels=warning,notice`). See https://simple-history.com/docs/feeds/ for all available filters. [#443](https://github.com/bonny/WordPress-Simple-History/issues/443)
-   Log when an admin user changes the way WordPress handles auto updates of core, from "automatic updates for all new versions of WordPress" to "automatic updates for maintenance and security releases only", or vice versa. [#449](https://github.com/bonny/WordPress-Simple-History/issues/449)
-   Add Update URI plugin header, if available, to context for plugin installs or updates. This field was added in [WordPress 5.8](https://make.wordpress.org/core/2021/06/29/introducing-update-uri-plugin-header-in-wordpress-5-8/) so it was really time to add it now :) [#451](https://github.com/bonny/WordPress-Simple-History/issues/451)
-   Add link to the Simple History site history below the "All updates have been completed" message that is shown when plugins or themes are updated. [#453](https://github.com/bonny/WordPress-Simple-History/issues/453)
-   Add title, alternative text, caption, description, and slug to modified attachments. [#310](https://github.com/bonny/WordPress-Simple-History/issues/310)
-   Add a link next to number or failed login attempts. If the [extended settings add-on](https://simple-history.com/add-ons/extended-settings/) is installed the link goes to the settings page for that add-on. If that add-on is not installed the link goes to the website of the add-on.

**Changed**

-   Changes to settings screens and logging of their options have gotten a major overhaul and is now much more user friendly and informative:

    -   Only built in WordPress options are logged. Previously other options could "sneak in" when they was added using a filter or similar on the same screen.
    -   When updating the site language option (the options `WPLANG`), set "en_US" as the language when the option is empty. Previously it was set to an empty string which what a bit confusing.
    -   "Week Starts On" now displays the new and previous weekday as human readable text instead of a number.
    -   Use wording "Updated setting..." instead of "Updated option..." in the log when a setting is updated because it's more user friendly to say "setting" instead of "option", since that's the wordings used in the WordPress UI.
    -   Include the name of the settings page in the main log message for each setting updated and also include a link to the settings page.
    -   Use "On" or "Off" when display the changed values for settings that can be toggled on or off. Previously "1" or "0" was used.
    -   Setting "For each post in a feed, include..." now displays "Full text" or "Excerpt", instead of "1" or "0".
    -   The "blog_public" settings is now shown as "Discourage search engines from indexing this site" setting was changed.

-   Don't log the uploading and deletion of the ZIP archive when installing a plugin or theme from a ZIP file. [#301](https://github.com/bonny/WordPress-Simple-History/issues/301)
-   Update testing framework wp-browser to 3.5.
-   Misc refactoring and code cleanup.

**Fixed**

-   Fix a possible strpos()-warning in the ACF logger. [#440](https://github.com/bonny/WordPress-Simple-History/issues/440)

### 4.4.0 (August 2023)

This version of Simple history is tested on the just released [WordPress 6.3](https://wordpress.org/news/2023/08/lionel/). It also contains some new features and bug fixes.

[Release post for Simple History 4.4.0](https://simple-history.com/2023/simple-history-4-4-0/).

**Added**

-   Logger for logging changes to the Simple History settings page. üôà And yes, it was quite embarrassing that the plugin itself did not log its activities.
-   RSS feed now accepts arguments to filter the events that are included in the feed. This makes it possible to subscribe to for example only WordPress core updates, or failed user logins, or any combination you want. See the documentation page for [available arguments and some examples](https://simple-history.com/docs/feeds/). [#387](https://github.com/bonny/WordPress-Simple-History/issues/387)
-   Event ID of each entry is included in WP-CLI output when running command `wp simple-history list`.
-   Filter `simple_history/settings/log_cleared` that is fired after the log has been cleared using the "Clear log now" button on the settings page.
-   Add helper function `is_plugin_active()` that loads the needed WordPress files before using the WordPress function with the same name. Part of fix for [#373](https://github.com/bonny/WordPress-Simple-History/issues/373).

**Fixed**

-   Shop changes to post type `customize_changeset`. Fix issue [#224](https://github.com/bonny/WordPress-Simple-History/issues/224) and support threads [stop the ‚ÄúUpdated changeset‚Äù and ‚ÄúMove changeset‚Äù notifications](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/stop-the-updated-changeset-and-move-changeset-notifications/), [Newbie question](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/newbie-question-65/).
-   Scrollbar on dashboard on RTL websites. Fixes issue [#212](https://github.com/bonny/WordPress-Simple-History/issues/212), support thread [Horizontal Scroll](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/horizontal-scroll-16/).
-   PHP error when showing a log entry when all core loggers are disabled. Fixes [#373](https://github.com/bonny/WordPress-Simple-History/issues/373).

**Changed**

-   Tested on WordPress 6.3.
-   Use `uniqid()` as cache invalidator instead of `time()`. Querying the log multiple times during the same PHP request with the same arguments, adding entries to the log between each log query, the same results would be returned.
-   Function `get_event_ip_number_headers()` moved from Simple Logger class to Helpers class.
-   Misc internal code cleanup.

### 4.3.0 (July 2023)

**Added**

-   Add action `simple_history/rss_feed/secret_updated` that is fired when the secret for the RSS feed is updated.
-   Add tests for RSS feed.

**Fixed**

-   RSS feed: Use `esc_xml` to escape texts. Fixes support thread [XML error with RSS feed](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/xml-error-with-rss-feed/), issue [#364](https://github.com/bonny/WordPress-Simple-History/issues/364).
-   RSS feed: Some texts was double escaped.
-   Plugin User Switching: store login and email context of user performing action, so information about a user exists even after user deletion. [#376](https://github.com/bonny/WordPress-Simple-History/issues/376).

### 4.2.1 (July 2023)

**Fixed**

-   Fix PHP error when running WP-Cron jobs on PHP 8 and something was to be logged. Fixes [#370](https://github.com/bonny/WordPress-Simple-History/issues/370) and support threads [wordpress.org/support/topic/fatal-error-4492/](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/fatal-error-4492/), [wordpress.org/support/topic/fatal-error-4488/](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/fatal-error-4488/), [wordpress.org/support/topic/php-error-in-lastest-version/](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/php-error-in-lastest-version/).

### 4.2.0 (July 2023)

-   Add helper function `camel_case_to_snake_case()`.
-   Automatically convert camelCase function names to snake_case function names when calling functions on the `\Simple_History` class. This way more old code and old examples will work. Fixes for example [support thread](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/uncaught-error-class-simplehistory/).

**Fixed**

-   Fix `Undefined property` warning when loading more similar events. [#357](https://github.com/bonny/WordPress-Simple-History/issues/357)
-   Include "Plugin URI" from plugin when logging single plugin installs. [#323](https://github.com/bonny/WordPress-Simple-History/issues/323)

**Removed**

-   Remove unused schedule `simple_history/purge_db`.
-   Remove function `filter_gettext_store_latest_translations()`.
-   Remove support for automatically un-translating messages to the log, loggers are better and have better support for languages.

### 4.1.0 (July 2023)

**Added**

-   Actions `simple_history/pause` and `simple_history/resume` to pause and resume logging. Useful for developers that for example write their own data importers because the log can be overwhelmed with data when importing a lot of data. [#307](https://github.com/bonny/WordPress-Simple-History/issues/307)
-   `clear_log()` now returns the number of rows deleted.
-   Added `disable_taxonomy_log()` to simplify disabling logging of a taxonomy.
-   Function `get_db_table_stats()` that returns for example the number of rows in each table.

### 4.0.1 (June 2023)

**Fixed**

-   Replace multibyte functions with non-multibyte versions, since `mbstring` is not a [required PHP extension](https://make.wordpress.org/hosting/handbook/server-environment/#php-extensions) (it is however a highly recommended one). Should fix https://wordpress.org/support/topic/wordpress-critical-error-9/. ([#351](https://github.com/bonny/WordPress-Simple-History/issues/351))

### 4.0.0 (June 2023)

üöÄ This update of Simple History contains some big changes ‚Äì that you hopefully won't even notice.

For regular users these are the regular additions and bug fixes:

**Changed**

-   Minimum required PHP version is 7.4. Users with lower versions can use [version 3.4.0 of the plugin](https://downloads.wordpress.org/plugin/simple-history.3.3.0.zip).
-   Minimum required WordPress version is 6.1.
-   Categories logger does not log changes to taxonomy `nav_menu` any longer, since the Menu logger takes care of those, i.e. changes to the menus.

**Added**

-   Log if "Send personal data export confirmation email" is checked when adding a Data Export Request.
-   Log when a Data Export Request is marked as complete.
-   Log when Personal Data is erased by an admin.
-   Log when a group is modified in Redirection plugin.
-   Added context key `export_content` to export logger. The key will contain the post type exported, or "all" if all content was exported.

**Fixed**

-   Fix error on MariaDB databases when collation `utf8mb4_unicode_520_ci` is used for the Simple history tables. Reported at: [https://wordpress.org/support/topic/database-error-after-upgrade-to-wordpress-6-1/](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/database-error-after-upgrade-to-wordpress-6-1/).
-   Privacy logger is logging the creation and selection of privacy page again. It stopped worked because [a WordPress core file was renamed](https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/43895).
-   Log when a groups is enabled, disabled, or deleted in Redirection plugin.

üë©‚Äçüíª For developers there are some bigger changes, that is noticeable:

-   The plugin now uses namespaces ‚Äì and they are loaded using an autoloader.
-   The code has been changed to follow [WordPress coding standard](https://developer.wordpress.org/coding-standards/wordpress-coding-standards/). This means that for example all functions have been renamed from `myFunctionName()` to `my_function_name()`.
-   The update to PHP 7.4 as the minimum required PHP version makes code more modern in so many ways and makes development easier and more funny, since we don't have to worry about backwards compatibility as much.
-   Many more tests using [wp-browser](https://wpbrowser.wptestkit.dev/) have has been added to minimize risk of bugs or fatal errors.

A more detailed changelog that probably most developers are interested in:

**Added**

-   Add cached = true|false to AJAX JSON answer when fetching events or checking for new events. It's a simple way to see if an object cache is in use and is working.
-   Most of the code now uses namespaces.
    -   The main namespace is `Simple_History`.
    -   The main class is `Simple_History\Simple_History`.
    -   Dropins use namespace `Simple_History\Dropins` and dropins must now extend the base class `Dropin`.
    -   Loggers use namespace `Simple_History\Loggers` and loggers must extend the base class `Logger`.
-   Add hooks that controls loggers and their instantiation: `simple_history/core_loggers`, `simple_history/loggers/instantiated`.
-   Add hooks that controls dropins and their instantiation: `simple_history/dropins_to_instantiate`, `simple_history/core_dropins`, `simple_history/dropins_to_instantiate`, `simple_history/dropin/instantiate_{$dropin_short_name}`, `simple_history/dropin/instantiate_{$dropin_short_name}`, `simple_history/dropins/instantiated`.
-   Add filter `simple_history/ip_number_header_names`.
-   Add methods `get_events_table_name()` and `get_contexts_table_name()`.
-   Call method `loaded()` on dropins when they are loaded (use this instead of `__construct`).
-   Make sure that a dropin class exists before trying to use it.

**Changed**

-   Improved code organization with the introduction of namespaces. Code now uses namespaces and classes (including loggers and dropins) are now loaded using an autoloader.
-   Functions are renamed to use `snake_case` (WordPress coding style) instead of `camelCase` (PHP PSR coding style). Some examples:
    -   `registerSettingsTab` is renamed to `register_settings_tab`.
-   Remove usage of deprectead function `wp_get_user_request_data()`.
-   Rename message key from `data_erasure_request_sent` to `data_erasure_request_added`.
-   Rename message key from `data_erasure_request_handled` to `data_erasure_request_completed`.
-   Applied code fixes using Rector and PHPStan for better code quality.
-   Add new class `Helpers` that contain helper functions.
-   Move functions `simple_history_get_current_screen()`, `interpolate()`, `text_diff`, `validate_ip`, `ends_with`, `get_cache_incrementor` to new helper class.
-   Function `get_ip_number_header_keys` is moved to helper class and renamed `get_ip_number_header_names`.
-   Class `SimpleHistoryLogQuery` renamed to `Log_Query`.
-   Class `SimpleLoggerLogLevels` renamed to `Log_Levels`.
-   Class `SimpleLoggerLogInitiators` renamed to `Log_Initiators`.
-   Dropin files are renamed.
-   Move init code in dropins from `__construct()` to new `loaded()` method.
-   Rename `getLogLevelTranslated()` to `get_log_level_translated()` and move to class `log_levels`.
-   Rename message key `user_application_password_deleted` to `user_application_password_revoked`.
-   Context key `args` is renamed to `export_args` in export logger. This key contains some of the options that was passed to export function, like author, category, start date, end date, and status.
-   Ensure loggers has a name and a slug set to avoid development oversights. `_doing_it_wrong()` will be called if they have not.
-   Logger: Method `get_info_value_by_key()` is now public so it can be used outside of a logger.
-   Logger: Method `get_info()` is now abstract, since it must be added by loggers.
-   For backwards compatibility `SimpleHistoryLogQuery`, `SimpleLoggerLogLevels`, `SimpleLoggerLogInitiators`, `SimpleLogger` will continue to exist for a couple of more versions.

**Removed**

-   Function `simple_history_add` has been removed. See [docs.simple-history.com/logging](https://docs.simple-history.com/logging) for other ways to add messages to the history log.
-   Unused function `sh_ucwords()` has been removed.

= 2.41.0 (March 2021) =

-   Fixed: Error when visiting settings screen on PHP 8.
    Fixes https://wordpress.org/support/topic/simple-history-fatal-error/.
    [#239](https://github.com/bonny/WordPress-Simple-History/issues/239)

= 2.40.0 (March 2021) =

-   Changed: IP address is now also shown when a user successfully logs in.
    Previously the IP address was only shown for failed login attempts. Note that the IP address/es of all events are always logged and can be seen in the "context data" table that is displayed when you click the date and time of an event.
    [#233](https://github.com/bonny/WordPress-Simple-History/issues/233)

-   Added: If multiple IP addresses are detected, for example when a website is running behind a proxy or similar, all IP addresses are now shown for failed and successful logins.

-   Added: Filter `simple_history/row_header_output/display_ip_address` that can be used to control when the IP address/es should be visible in the main log. By default successful and failed logins are shown.

-   Added: Show message when failing to get IP address due to for example ad blocker. IPInfo.io is for example blocked in the EasyList filter list that for example [Chrome extension uBlock Origin](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ublock-origin/cjpalhdlnbpafiamejdnhcphjbkeiagm) uses.

-   Added: Filter `simple_history/row_header_output/template` that controls the output of the header row in the main event log.

= 2.39.0 (January 2021) =

-   Added: Logging of events that a user performs via the [WP Crontrol](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-crontrol/) plugin (requires WP Crontrol version 1.9.0 or later). Simple History will log when cron events are added, edited, deleted, and manually ran, and when cron schedules are added and deleted. Props https://github.com/johnbillion.

= 2.38.0 (November 2020) =

-   Changed: It's now possible to log things before the `after_setup_theme` hook by using the `SimpleLogger()` function. Before this change calling `SimpleLogger()` before `after_setup_theme`, or on `after_setup_theme` with a prio smaller than 10, would result in a fatal error (`Fatal error: Uncaught Error: Class 'SimpleLogger' not found`). Props https://github.com/JoryHogeveen.

-   Changed: More custom post types that use the block editor ("Gutenberg") should now have their changes logged. Props https://github.com/claytoncollie.

= 2.37.2 (September 2020) =

-   Fixed: Even more code that was to new for PHP 5.6 (I do have some tests, I just didn't look at them `¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø`.)

= 2.37.1 (September 2020) =

-   Fixed: Some code was to new for PHP 5.6.

= 2.37 (September 2020) =

-   Added: Enabling or disabling plugin auto-updates is now logged.
-   Added: Function `sh_d()` that echoes any number of variables to the screen.
-   Fixed: User logouts did show "other" instead of username of user logging out. Fixes #206, https://wordpress.org/support/topic/suspicious-logged-out-events/, https://wordpress.org/support/topic/login-logout-tracking/.
-   Updated: lots of code to be formatted more according to PSR12.

= 2.36 (August 2020) =

-   Fix plus and minus icons in quick diff.

-   Adjust style of pagination to match WordPress core pagination.

= 2.33.2 (January 2020) =

-   Was just an internal test version.

= 2.33 (November 2019) =

-   Fix join parameter order for PHP 7.4.
-   Update donate link. It's now https://www.paypal.me/eskapism.

    A very small amount makes me much more happy than nothing at all! ;)

= 2.32 (August 2019) =

-   Fix error in Beaver Builder logger. Fixes https://wordpress.org/support/topic/conflict-with-beaver-builder-plugin-4/.
-   Add filter `simple_history/admin_location` that makes is possible to move the main page from the dashboard menu to any other menu page, for example the Tools menu. Fixes https://github.com/bonny/WordPress-Simple-History/issues/140. Example usage of filter:

```php
// Move Simple History log sub page from the "Dashboard" menu to the "Tools" menu.
add_filter('simple_history/admin_location', function ($location) {
	$location = 'tools';
	return $location;
});
```

-   Make it easier to extend SimplePostLogger by making `$old_post_data` protected instead of private. https://github.com/bonny/WordPress-Simple-History/pull/173.
-   Try to use taxonomy name instead of taxonomy slug when showing term additions or modifications. Fixes https://github.com/bonny/WordPress-Simple-History/issues/164.

-   Remove unused old function `testlog_old()`.
-   Move helper functions to own file.

-   Store if post password has been set, unset, or changed.
-   Store if a log entry comes from the REST API. Stored in the event context as `_rest_api_request`.
-   Check that logger messages exists and is array before trying to use.
-   Bump required version in readme to 5.4. It's just to difficult to keep the plugin compatible with PHP less than [PHP version 5.4](http://php.net/manual/en/migration54.new-features.php).
-   Updates to some translation strings.

= 2.29.2 (January 2019) =

-   Fix for (the still great) plugin [Advanced Custom Fields](http://advancedcustomfields.com) 5.7.10 that removed the function `_acf_get_field_by_id` that this plugin used. Fixes https://wordpress.org/support/topic/uncaught-error-call-to-undefined-function-_acf_get_field_by_id/.

= 2.29.1 (December 2018) =

-   Fix another PHP 7.3 warning. Should fix https://wordpress.org/support/topic/php-7-3-compatibility-3/.

= 2.29 (December 2018) =

-   Make log welcome message translatable.
-   Add two filters to make it more ease to control via filters if a logger and the combination logger + message should be logged. - `"simple_history/log/do_log/{$this->slug}"` controls if any messages for a specific logger should be logged. Simply return false to this filter to disable all logging to that logger. - `"simple_history/log/do_log/{$this->slug}/{$message_key}"` controls if a specific message for a specific logger should be logged. Simply return false to this filter to disable all logging to that logger. - Code examples for the two filters above:

    ````
    // Disable logging of any user message, i.e. any message from the logger SimpleUserLogger.
    add_filter( 'simple_history/log/do_log/SimpleUserLogger', '\_\_return_false' );

        		// Disable logging of updated posts, i.e. the message "post_updated" from the logger SimplePostLogger.
        		add_filter( 'simple_history/log/do_log/SimplePostLogger/post_updated', '__return_false' );
        		```

    ````

-   add_filter('simple_history/log/do_log/SimpleUserLogger', '\_\_return_false');
-   Fix notice in Redirection plugin logger due because redirection plugin can have multiple target types. Props @MaximVanhove.
-   Fix warning because of missing logging messages in the categories/tags logger. Props @JeroenSormani.
-   Fix warning in the next version of PHP, PHP 7.3.

= 2.28.1 (September 2018) =

-   Remove a debug message that was left in the code.

= 2.28 (September 2018) =

-   Always show time and sometimes date before each event, in addition to the relative date. Fixes https://wordpress.org/support/topic/feature-request-granular-settings-changes-detailed-timestamp/.
-   Use WordPress own function (`wp_privacy_anonymize_ip`, available since WordPress version 4.9.6) to anonymize IP addresses, instead of our own class.
-   Update timeago.js

= 2.27 (August 2018) =

-   Fix notice errors when syncing an ACF field group. Fixes https://github.com/bonny/WordPress-Simple-History/issues/150.
-   Fix notice error when trying to read plugin info for a plugin that no longer exists or has changed name. Fixes https://github.com/bonny/WordPress-Simple-History/issues/146.
-   Always load the SimpleLogger logger. Fixes https://github.com/bonny/WordPress-Simple-History/issues/129.
-   Make more texts translatable.
-   Show plugin slug instead of name when translations are updated and a plugin name is not provided by the upgrader. This can happen when a plugin is using an external update service, like EDD.
-   Group translation updates in the log. Useful because sometimes you update a lot of translations at the same time and the log is full of just those messages.

= 2.26.1 (July 2018) =

-   Fix 5.3 compatibility.

= 2.26 (July 2018) =

-   Add support for the [Jetpack plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/jetpack/). To begin with, activation and deactivation of Jetpack modules is logged.
-   Add logging of translation updates, so now you can see when a plugin or a theme has gotten new translations. Fixes https://github.com/bonny/WordPress-Simple-History/issues/147.
-   Fix notice in Advanced Custom Fields logger when saving an ACF options page.
    Fixes https://wordpress.org/support/topic/problem-with-acf-options-pages/, https://wordpress.org/support/topic/problem-with-recent-version-and-acf/, https://github.com/bonny/WordPress-Simple-History/issues/145.

= 2.25 (July 2018) =

-   Fix for sometimes missing user name and user email in export file.

= 2.24 (July 2018) =

-   Clear database in smaller steps. Fixes https://github.com/bonny/WordPress-Simple-History/issues/143.
-   Fix notice in ACF logger due to misspelled variable. Fixes https://wordpress.org/support/topic/problem-with-recent-version-and-acf/.

= 2.23.1 (May 2018) =

-   Remove some debug messages that was outputted to the error log. Fixes https://wordpress.org/support/topic/errors-in-php-log-since-v2-23/.
-   Fix error because function `ucwords()` does not allow a second argument on PHP versions before 5.4.32. Fixes https://wordpress.org/support/topic/error-message-since-last-update/, https://wordpress.org/support/topic/errors-related-to-php-version/.
-   Added new function `sh_ucwords()` that works like `ucwords()` but it also works on PHP 5.3.

= 2.23 (May 2018) =

-   Add logging of privacy and GDPR related functions in WordPress. Some of the new [privacy related features in WordPress 4.9.6](https://wordpress.org/news/2018/05/wordpress-4-9-6-privacy-and-maintenance-release/) that are logged: - Privacy policy page is created or changed to a new page. - Privacy data export is requested for a user and when this request is confirmed by the user and when the data for the request is downloaded by an admin or emailed to the user. - Erase Personal Data: Request is added for user to have their personal data erased, user confirms the data removal and when the deletion of user data is done.
-   Fix error when categories changes was shown in the log. Fixes https://wordpress.org/support/topic/php-notice-undefined-variable-term_object/.
-   Fix error when a ACF Field Group was saved.
-   Fix error when the IP address anonymization function tried to anonymize an empty IP address. Could happen when for example running wp cron locally on your server.
-   Fix error when calling the REST API with an API endpoint with a closure as the callback. Fixes https://github.com/bonny/WordPress-Simple-History/issues/141.
-   Rewrote logger loading method so now it's possible to name your loggers in a WordPress codings standard compatible way. Also: made a bit more code more WordPress-ish.
-   The post types in the `skip_posttypes` filter are now also applied to deleted posts.
-   Add function `sh_get_callable_name()` that returns a human readable name for a callback.

= 2.22.1 (May 2018) =

-   Fix for some REST API Routes not working, for example when using WPCF7. Should fix https://wordpress.org/support/topic/errorexception-with-wpcf7/ and similar.

= 2.22 (May 2018) =

-   IP addresses are now anonymized by default. This is mainly done because of the [General Data Protection Regulation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Data_Protection_Regulation) (GDPR)
    Both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses will be anonymized and the IP addresses are anonymized to their network ID.
    So for example the IPv4 address `192.168.123.124` is anonymized to `192.168.123.0` and
    the IPv6 address `2a03:2880:2110:df07:face:b00c::1` is anonymized by default to `2610:28:3090:3001::`.

-   Added filter `simple_history/privacy/anonymize_ip_address` than can be used to disable ip address anonymization.

-   Added function `sh_error_log()` to easily log variables to the error log. Probably only of interest to developers.

-   Fixed logging for [plugin Redirection](https://wordpress.org/plugins/redirection/). The logging of URL redirects and so on stopped working some while back because the Redirection plugin started using the WP REST API. But now it's working again!

= 2.21.1 (May 2018) =

-   Make sure support for Advanced Custom Fields is activated for all users ‚Äì and not only for the developer of the plugin ;)

= 2.21 (May 2018) =

-   Added support for Advanced Custom Fields (ACF): when a ACF Field or ACF Field Group is created or modified or deleted you will now get more details in the activity feed.
-   Changes to taxonomies/categories/tags now include a link to the modified term and to the category that the term belongs to.
-   The post types in the `skip_posttypes` filter are now also applied to trashed and untrashed posts (not only post edits, as before).
-   Don't log Jetpack sitemap updates. (Don't log updates to posttypes `jp_sitemap`, `jp_sitemap_master` and `jp_img_sitemap`, i.e. the post types used by Jetpack's Sitemap function.) Should fix https://wordpress.org/support/topic/jetpack-sitemap-logging/.
-   Don't log the taxonomies `post_translations` or `term_translations`, that are used by Polylang to store translation mappings. That contained md5-hashed strings and was not of any benefit (a separate logger for Polylang will come soon anyway).
-   Fix notice in theme logger because did not check if `$_POST['sidebar']` was set. Fixes https://github.com/bonny/WordPress-Simple-History/issues/136.
-   Fix thumbnail title missing notice in post logger.
-   Fix PHP warning when a plugin was checked by WordPress for an update, but your WordPress install did not have the plugin folder for that plugin.
-   Fix unexpected single-quotations included in file name in Internet Explorer 11 (and possibly other versions) when exporting CSV/JSON file.
-   Fix filter/search log by specific users not working. Fixes https://wordpress.org/support/topic/show-activity-from-other-authors-only/.
-   Fix a notice in SimpleOptionsLogger.
-   Better CSS styling on dashboard.
-   Add filter `simple_history/post_logger/post_updated/context` that can be used to modify the context added by SimplePostLogger.
-   Add filter `simple_history/post_logger/post_updated/ok_to_log` that can be used to skip logging a post update.
-   Add filter `simple_history/categories_logger/skip_taxonomies` that can be used to modify what taxonomies to skip when logging updates to taxonomy terms.

= 2.20 (November 2017) =

-   Add logging of post thumbnails.
-   Use medium size of image attachments when showing uploaded files in the log. Previously a custom size was used, a size that most sites did not have and instead the full size image would be outputted = waste of bandwidth.
-   Make image previews smaller because many uploaded images could make the log a bit to long and not so quick to overview.
-   Update Select2 to latest version. Fixes https://wordpress.org/support/topic/select2-js-is-outdated/.
-   Show a message if user is running to old WordPress version, and don't continue running the code of this plugin.
    Should fix stuff like https://wordpress.org/support/topic/simple-history-i-cannot-login/.
-   Fix an error with PHP 7.1.

= 2.19 (November 2017) =

-   Add filter `simple_history/user_can_clear_log`. Return `false` from this filter to disable the "Clear blog" button.
-   Remove static keyword from some methods in SimpleLogger, so now calls like `SimpleLogger()->critical('Doh!');` works.
-   Don't show link to WordPress updates if user is not allowed to view the updates page.
-   Fix notice error in SimpleOptionsLogger.
-   Fix for fatal errors when using the lost password form in [Membership 2](https://wordpress.org/plugins/membership/). Fixes https://wordpress.org/support/topic/conflict-with-simple-history-plugin-and-php-7/.
-   Code (a little bit) better formatted according to [WordPress coding standard](https://github.com/WordPress-Coding-Standards/WordPress-Coding-Standards).

= 2.18 (August 2017) =

-   Set from_term_description correctly, fixes https://github.com/bonny/WordPress-Simple-History/issues/127.
-   Add filter `simple_history/post_logger/skip_posttypes`.
-   Don't log post type `jetpack_migation` because for some users that post type filled the log. Fixes https://wordpress.org/support/topic/updated-jetpack_migration-sidebars_widgets/.

= 2.17 (June 2017) =

-   Fix search date range inputs not showing correctly.
-   Change the message for when a plugin is deactivated due to an error. Now the plugin slug is included, so you know exactly what plugin has been deactivated. Also the reason for the deactivation is included (one of "Invalid plugin path", "Plugin file does not exist", or "The plugin does not have a valid header.").
-   Added more filters to log message. Now filter `simple_history_log_debug` exists, together with filters for all other 7 log levels. So you can use `simple_history_log_{loglevel}` where {loglevel} is any of emergency, alert, critical, error, warning, notice, info or debug.
-   Add support for logging the changing of "locale" on a user profile, something that was added in WordPress 4.7.
-   Add sidebar box with link to the settings page.
-   Don't log when old posts are deleted from the trash during cron job wp_scheduled_delete.
-   HHVM is not used for any tests any longer because PHP 7 and Travis not supporting it or something. I dunno. Something like that.
-   When "development debug mode" is activated also log current filters.
-   Show an admin warning if a logger slug is longer than 30 chars.
-   Fix fatal error when calling log() method with null as context argument.

= 2.16 (May 2017) =

-   Added [WP-CLI](https://wp-cli.org) command for Simple History. Now you can write `wp simple-history list` to see the latest entries from the history log. For now `list` is the only available command. Let me know if you need more commands!
-   Added support for logging edits to theme files and plugin files. When a file is edited you will also get a quick diff on the changes,
    so you can see what CSS styles a client changed or what PHP changes they made in a plugin file.
-   Removed the edit file logger from the plugin logger, because it did not always work (checked wrong wp path). Instead the new Theme and plugins logger mentioned above will take care of this.

= 2.15 (May 2017) =

-   Use thumbnail version of PDF preview instead of full size image.
-   Remove Google Maps image when clicking IP address of failed login and similar, because Google Maps must be used with API key.
    Hostname, Network, City, Region and Country is still shown.
-   Fix notice in available updates logger.
-   Fix notice in redirection logger.

= 2.14.1 (April 2017) =

-   Fix for users running on older PHP versions.

= 2.14 (April 2017) =

-   Added support for plugin [Duplicate Post](https://wordpress.org/plugins/duplicate-post/).
    Now when a user clones a post or page you will se this in the history log, with links to both the original post and the new copy.
-   Removed log level info from title in RSS feed
-   Make date dropdown less "jumpy" when loading page (due to select element switching to Select2)
-   Only add filters for plugin Limit Login Attempts if plugin is active. This fixes problem with Limit Login Attempts Reloaded and possibly other forks of the plugin.
-   Debug page now displays installed plugins.

= 2.13 (November 2016) =

-   Added filter `simple_history_log` that is a simplified way to add message to the log, without the need to check for the existence of Simple History or its SimpleLogger function. Use it like this: `apply_filters("simple_history_log", "This is a logged message");` See the [examples file](https://github.com/bonny/WordPress-Simple-History/blob/master/examples/examples.php) for more examples.
-   IP info now displays a popup with map + geolocation info for users using HTTPS again. Thanks to the great https://twitter.com/ipinfoio for letting all users use their service :)
-   Fix notice warning for missing `$data_parent_row`

= 2.12 (September 2016) =

-   You can show a different number of log items in the log on the dashboard and on the dedicated history page. By default the dashboard will show 5 items and the page will show 30.
-   On multisites the user search filter now only search users in the current site.
-   The statistics chart using Chart.js now uses the namespace window.Simple_History_Chart instead of window.Chart, decreasing the risk that two versions of the Chart.js library overwriting each others. Fixes https://wordpress.org/support/topic/comet-cache-breaks-simple-history/. (Note to future me: this was fixed by renaming the `window.chart` variable to `window.chart.Simple_history_chart` in the line `window.Chart = module.exports = Chart;`)
-   If spam comments are logged they are now included in the log. Change made to make sql query shorter and easier. Should not actually show any spam comments anyway because we don't log them since version 2.5.5 anyway. If you want to revert this behavior for some reason you can use the filter `simple_history/comments_logger/include_spam`.

= 2.11 (September 2016) =

-   Added support for plugin [Redirection](https://wordpress.org/plugins/redirection/).
    Redirects and groups that are created, changed, enabled and disabled will be logged. Also when the plugin global settings are changed that will be logged.
-   Fix possible notice error from User logger.
-   "View changelog" link now works on multisite.

= 2.10 (September 2016) =

-   Available updates to plugins, themes, and WordPress itself is now logged.
    Pretty great if you subscribe to the RSS feed to get the changes on a site. No need to manually check the updates-page to see if there are any updates.
-   Changed to logic used to determine if a post edit should be logged or not. Version 2.9 used a version that started to log a bit to much for some plugins. This should fix the problems with the Nextgen Gallery, All-In-One Events Calendar, and Membership 2 plugins. If you still have problems with a plugin that is causing to many events to be logged, please let me know!

= 2.9.1 (August 2016) =

-   Fixed an issue where the logged time was off by some hours, due to timezone being manually set elsewhere.
    Should fix https://wordpress.org/support/topic/logged-time-off-by-2-hours and https://wordpress.org/support/topic/different-time-between-dashboard-and-logger.
-   Fixed Nextgen Gallery and Nextgen Gallery Plus logging lots and lots of event when viewing posts with galleries. The posts was actually updated, so this plugin did nothing wrong. But it was indeed a bit annoying and most likely something you didn't want in your log. Fixes https://wordpress.org/support/topic/non-stop-logging-nextgen-gallery-items.

= 2.9 (August 2016) =

-   Added custom date ranges to the dates filter. Just select "Custom date range..." in the dates dropdown and you can choose to see the log between any two exact dates.
-   The values in the statistics graph can now be clicked and when clicked the log is filtered to only show logged events from that day. Very convenient if you have a larger number of events logged for one day and quickly want to find out what exactly was logged that day.
-   Dates filter no longer accepts multi values. It was indeed a bit confusing that you could select both "Last 7 days" and "Last 3 days".
-   Fix for empty previous plugin version (the `{plugin_prev_version}` placeholder) when updating plugins.
-   Post and pages updates done in the WordPress apps for Ios and Android should be logged again.

= 2.8 (August 2016) =

-   Theme installs are now logged
-   ...and so are theme updates
-   ...and theme deletions. Awesome!
-   Support for plugin [Limit Login Attempts](https://wordpress.org/plugins/limit-login-attempts/).
    Failed login attempts, lockouts and configuration changes will be logged.
-   Correct message is now used when a plugin update fails, i.e. the message for key `plugin_update_failed`.
-   The original untranslated strings for plugin name and so on are stored when storing info for plugin installs and updates and similar.
-   Default number of events to show is now 10 instead of 5.

= 2.7.5 (August 2016) =

-   User logins using e-mail are now logged correctly. Previously the user would be logged in successfully but the log said that they failed.
-   Security fix: only users with [`list_users`](https://codex.wordpress.org/Roles_and_Capabilities#list_users) capability can view the users filter and use the autocomplete api for users.
    Previously the autocomplete function could be used by all logged in users.
-   Add labels to search filters. (I do really hate label-less forms so it's kinda very strange that this was not in place before.)
-   Misc other internal fixes

= 2.7.4 (July 2016) =

-   Log a warning message if a plugin gets disabled automatically by WordPress because of any of these errors: "Plugin file does not exist.", "Invalid plugin path.", "The plugin does not have a valid header."
-   Fix warning error if `on_wp_login()` was called without second argument.
-   Fix options diff not being shown correctly.
-   Fix notice if no message key did exist for a log message.

= 2.7.3 (June 2016) =

-   Removed the usage of the mb\_\* functions and mbstring is no longer a requirement.
-   Added a new debug tab to the settings page. On the debug page you can see stuff like how large your database is and how many rows that are stored in the database. Also, a list of all loggers are listed there together with some useful (for developers anyway) information.

= 2.7.2 (June 2016) =

-   Fixed message about mbstring required not being echo'ed.
-   Fixed notice errors for users not allowed to view the log.

= 2.7.1 (June 2016) =

-   Added: Add shortcut to history in Admin bar for current site and in Network Admin Bar for each site where plugin is installed. Can be disabled using filters `simple_history/add_admin_bar_menu_item` and `simple_history/add_admin_bar_network_menu_item`.
-   Added: Add check that [¬¥mbstring¬¥](http://php.net/manual/en/book.mbstring.php) is enabled and show a warning if it's not.
-   Changed: Changes to "Front Page Displays" in "Reading Settings" now show the name of the old and new page (before only id was logged).
-   Changed: Changes to "Default Post Category" and "Default Mail Category" in "Writing Settings" now show the name of the old and new category (before only id was logged).
-   Fixed: When changing "Front Page Displays" in "Reading Settings" the option "rewrite_rules" also got logged.
-   Fixed: Changes in Permalink Settings were not logged correctly.
-   Fixed: Actions done with [WP-CLI](https://wp-cli.org/) was not correctly attributed. Now the log should say "WP-CLI" instead of "Other" for actions done in WP CLI.

= 2.7 (May 2016) =

-   Added: When a user is created or edited the log now shows what fields have changed and from what old value to what new value. A much requested feature!
-   Fixed: If you edited your own profile the log would say that you edited "their profile". Now it says that you edited "your profile" instead.
-   Changed: Post diffs could get very tall. Now they are max approx 8 rows by default, but if you hover the diff (or give it focus with your keyboard) you get a scrollbar and can scroll the contents. Fixes https://wordpress.org/support/topic/dashboard-max-length-of-content and https://wordpress.org/support/topic/feature-request-make-content-diff-report-expandable-and-closed-by-default.
-   Fixed: Maybe fix a notice warning if a transient was missing a name or value.

= 2.6 (May 2016) =

-   Added: A nice little graph in the sidebar that displays the number of logged events per day the last 28 days. Graph is powered by [Chart.js](http://www.chartjs.org/).
-   Added: Function `get_num_events_last_n_days()`
-   Added: Function `get_num_events_per_day_last_n_days()`
-   Changed: Switched to transients from cache at some places, because more people will benefit from transients instead of cache (that requires object cache to be installed).
-   Changed: New constant `SETTINGS_GENERAL_OPTION_GROUP`. Fixes https://wordpress.org/support/topic/constant-for-settings-option-group-name-option_group.
-   Fixed: Long log messages with no spaces would get cut of. Now all the message is shown, but with one or several line breaks. Fixes https://github.com/bonny/WordPress-Simple-History/pull/112.
-   Fixed: Some small CSS modification to make the page less "jumpy" while loading (for example setting a default height to the select2 input box).

= 2.5.5 (April 2016) =

-   Changed: The logger for Enable Media Replace required the capability `edit_files` to view the logged events, but since this also made it impossible to view events if the constant `DISALLOW_FILE_EDIT` was true. Now Enable Media Replace requires the capability `upload_files` instead. Makes more sense. Fixes https://wordpress.org/support/topic/simple-history-and-disallow_file_edit.
-   Changed: No longer log spam trackbacks or comments. Before this version these where logged, but not shown.
-   Fixed: Translations was not loaded for Select2. Fixes https://wordpress.org/support/topic/found-a-string-thats-not-translatable-v-254.
-   Fixed: LogQuery `date_to`-argument was using `date_from`.
-   Changed: The changelog for 2015 and earlier are now moved to [CHANGELOG.md](https://github.com/bonny/WordPress-Simple-History/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md).

= 2.5.4 (March 2016) =

-   Added: Support for new key in info array from logger: "name_via". Set this value in a logger and the string will be shown next to the date of the logged event. Useful when logging actions from third party plugins, or any kind of other logging that is not from WordPress core.
-   Added: Method `getInfoValueByKey` added to the SimpleLogger class, for easier retrieval of values from the info array of a logger.
-   Fixed: Themes could no be deleted. Fixes https://github.com/bonny/WordPress-Simple-History/issues/98 and https://wordpress.org/support/topic/deleting-theme-1.
-   Fixed: Notice error when generating permalink for event.
-   Fixed: Removed a `console.log()`.
-   Changed: Check that array key is integer or string. Hopefully fixes https://wordpress.org/support/topic/error-in-wp-adminerror_log.

= 2.5.3 (February 2016) =

-   Fixed: Old entries was not correctly removed. Fixes https://github.com/bonny/WordPress-Simple-History/issues/108.

= 2.5.2 (February 2016) =

-   Added: The GUI log now updates the relative "fuzzy" timestamps in real time. This means that if you keep the log opened, the relative date for each event, for example "2 minutes ago" or "2 hours ago", will always be up to date (hah!). Keep the log opened for 5 minutes and you will see that the event that previously said "2 minutes ago" now says "7 minutes ago". Fixes https://github.com/bonny/WordPress-Simple-History/issues/88 and is implemented using the great [timeago jquery plugin](http://timeago.yarp.com/).
-   Added: Filter `simple_history/user_logger/plain_text_output_use_you`. Works the same way as the `simple_history/header_initiator_use_you` filter, but for the rich text part when a user has edited their profile.
-   Fixed: Logger slugs that contained for example backslashes (because they where namespaced) would not show up in the log. Now logger slugs are escaped. Fixes https://github.com/bonny/WordPress-Simple-History/issues/103.
-   Changed: Actions and things that only is needed in admin area are now only called if `is_admin()`. Fixes https://github.com/bonny/WordPress-Simple-History/issues/105.

= 2.5.1 (February 2016) =

-   Fixed: No longer assume that the ajaxurl don't already contains query params. Should fix problems with third party plugins like [WPML](https://wpml.org/).
-   Fixed: Notice if context key did not exist. Should fix https://github.com/bonny/WordPress-Simple-History/issues/100.
-   Fixed: Name and title on dashboard and settings page were not translatable. Fixes https://wordpress.org/support/topic/dashboard-max-length-of-content.
-   Fixed: Typo when user resets password.
-   Added: Filter `simple_history/row_header_date_output`.
-   Added: Filter `simple_history/log/inserted`.
-   Added: Filter `simple_history/row_header_date_output`.

= 2.5 (December 2015) =

-   Added: Category edits are now logged, so now you can see terms, categories and taxonomies that are added, changed, and deleted. Fixes for example https://wordpress.org/support/topic/view-changes-to-categories and https://twitter.com/hmarafi/status/655994402037362688.
-   Fixed: The media logger now shows the width and height of uploaded images again.
-   Fixed: IP Lookup using ipinfo.io would fail if your site was using HTTPS (pro account on ipinfo.io required for that), so now falls back to opening a link to ipinfo.io in a new tab instead.
-   Fixed: If there was a server error while loading the log, the error would be shown, to help you debug any errors. The error would however not go away if you successfully loaded the log again. Now it does.
-   Changed: The search/filter now falls back to showing events for the last 14 days, if 30 days would return over 1000 pages of events. This change is to try to make the log fail to load in less scenarios. If a site got a bit spike if brute force attacks (yes, it's always those attacks!) then there could be a big jump in the number of events and pages between 14 days and 30 days.
-   Changed: Failed login attempts now use shorter messages and shorter variable names. Not really the fault of this plugin, but sites can get a huge amount of failed login attempts logged. Sites with almost 2 million logged rows just in the last 60 days for example. And that will cause the database tables with the history to grow to several hundreds of megabyte. So to make those tables a bit smaller the plugin now uses shorter messages for failed login attempts, shorter variable names, and it stores less data. If you want to stop hackers from attacking your site (resulting in big history logs) you should install a plugin like [Jetpack and its BruteProtect module](https://jetpack.me/support/security-features/).
-   Updated: Added date filter to show just events from just one day. Useful for sites that get hammered by brute force login attempts. On one site where I had 166434 login attempts the last 7 days this helped to make the log actually load :/.
-   Updated: New French translation

= 2.4 (November 2015) =

-   Added: Now logs when a user changes their password using the "reset password" link.
-   Added: Now logs when a user uses the password reset form.
-   Added: New method `register_dropin` that can be used to add dropins.
-   Added: New action `simple_history/add_custom_dropin`.
-   Added: Example on how to add an external dropin: [example-dropin.php](https://github.com/bonny/WordPress-Simple-History/blob/master/examples/example-dropin.php).
-   Added: "Last day" added to filter, because a brute force attack can add so many logs that it's not possible to fetch a whole week.
-   Changed: Filter `simple_history/log/do_log` now pass 5 arguments instead of 3. Before this update in was not possible for multiple add_action()-calls to use this filter, because you would not now if any other code had canceled it and so on. If you have been using this filter you need to modify your code.
-   Changed: When hovering the time of an event in the log, the date of the event displays in both local time and GMT time. Hopefully makes it easier for admins in different timezones that work together on a site to understand when each event happened. Fixes https://github.com/bonny/WordPress-Simple-History/issues/84.
-   Fixed: Line height was a bit tight on the dashboard. Also: the margin was a tad to small for the first logged event on the dashboard.
-   Fixed: Username was not added correctly to failed login attempts when using plugin Captcha on Login + it would still show that a user logged out sometimes when a bot/script brute force attacked a site by only sending login and password and not the captcha field.

= 2.3.1 (October 2015) =

-   Fixed: Hopefully fixed the wrong relative time, as reported at URL: https://wordpress.org/support/topic/wrong-reporting-time.
-   Changed: The RSS-feed with updates is now disabled by default for new installs. It is password protected, but some users felt that is should be optional to activate it. And now it is! Thanks to https://github.com/guillaumemolter for adding this feature.
-   Fixed: Failed login entries when using plugin [Captcha on Login](https://wordpress.org/plugins/captcha-on-login/) was reported as "Logged out" when they really meant "Failed to log in". Please note that this was nothing that Simple History did wrong, it was rather Captcha on Login that manually called `wp_logout()` each time a user failed to login. Should fix all those mystery "Logged out"-entries some of you users had.
-   Added: Filter `simple_history/log/do_log` that can be used to shortcut the log()-method.
-   Updated: German translation updated.

= 2.3 (October 2015) =

-   Added: The title of the browser tab with Simple History open will now show the number of new and unread events available. Nice feature to have if you keep a tab with the Simple History log open but in the background: now you can see directly in the title if new events are available. Such small change. Very much nice.
-   Added: If the AJAX call to fetch the log failed, a message now appears telling the user that something went wrong. Also, the output from the server is displayed so they can get a hint of what's going wrong. Hopefully this will reduce the number of support requests that is caused by other plugins.
-   Fixed: Edited posts/pages/custom post types does not get a linked title unless the user viewing the log has edit rights.
-   Fixed: Another try to fix the notice error: https://wordpress.org/support/topic/simplehistoryphp-creates-debug-entries.
-   Updated: Danish translation updated.
-   Updated: POT file updated.

= 2.2.4 (September 2015) =

-   Added: Basic support for plugin [Ultimate Member](https://wordpress.org/plugins/ultimate-member/), so users logging in using the plugin will now be logged in Simple History. Fixes https://wordpress.org/support/topic/compatibility-with-ultimate-member.
-   Added: Filter `simple_history/logger/interpolate/context` that can be used to modify the variables sent to the message template.
-   Changed: Remove "type" key from context detail table, because it's an old an unused column.
-   Changed: During a first install the plugin now creates a few less columns than before (some columns where left from version 1 of the plugin).
-   Changed: Don't show the "translate this plugin" metabox for any english talking locale.
-   Changed: Don't show the GitHub metabox.
-   Fixed: If the plugin is deleted (but why?!) then the context table is also removed now.
-   Behind the scenes: More unit tests! Hopefully more nasty things will get caught before releasing new versions of the plugin.

= 2.2.3 (September 2015) =

-   Fixed: On new installs the database tables was not created correctly and new events could not be logged.

= 2.2.2 (September 2015) =

-   Fixed: Logging stopped working for languages other then English. Sorry about that!
-   Fixed: When running unit tests for a site where Simple History is a must use plugin it sometimes tried to create tables and add columns more then once. Now uses `if not exists` and similar to only try to create the tables if they not already exists.

= 2.2.1 (September 2015) =

-   Fixed: Missed to log users switching back on using the User Switching plugin. Fixes https://github.com/bonny/WordPress-Simple-History/issues/89.

= 2.2 (September 2015) =

-   Added: Support for plugin [User Switching](https://wordpress.org/plugins/user-switching/). The event log will show when a user switched to another user, when they switched back, or when they switched off.
-   Added: Support for plugin [Enable Media Replace](https://wordpress.org/plugins/enable-media-replace/). Whenever a user replaces an attachment with a new, you will now know about it and also see the name of both the old and the new attachment. Awesome!
-   Fixed: Mouse over (:hover state) on buttons no longer use blue background. Now works much better with admin themes other than the standard one. Fixes https://wordpress.org/support/topic/pagination-button-design.

= 2.1.7 (September 2015) =

-   Fixed: Date and time in the log was using GMT time rather than local time. Could be confusing. Even very confusing if living in a time zone far far away from the GMT zone.

= 2.1.6 (August 2015) =

-   Updated: Danish translation updated. Thanks translator!
-   Fixed: Icon on settings page was a bit unaligned on WordPress not running the latest beta version (hrm, which I guess most of you were..)
-   Fixed: Possible php notice. Should fix https://wordpress.org/support/topic/simplehistoryphp-creates-debug-entries.
-   Changed: Logged messages are now trimmed by default (spaces and new lines will be removed from messages).
-   Updated: When installing and activating the plugin it will now add the same "plugin installed" and "plugin activated" message that other plugins get when they are installed. These events where not logged before because the plugin was not installed and could therefor not log its own installation. Solution was to log it manually. Works. Looks good. But perhaps a bit of cheating.
-   Added: A (hopefully) better welcome message when activating the plugin for the first time. Hopefully the new message makes new users understand a bit better why the log may be empty at first.

= 2.1.5 (August 2015) =

-   Fixed: It was not possible to modify the filters `simple_history/view_settings_capability` and `simple_history/view_history_capability` from the `functions.php`-file in a theme (filters where applied too early - they did however work from within a plugin!)
-   Changed: Use `h1` instead of `h2` on admin screens. Reason for this the changes in 4.3: https://make.wordpress.org/core/2015/07/31/headings-in-admin-screens-change-in-wordpress-4-3/.
-   Removed: the constant `VERSION` is now removed. Use constant `SIMPLE_HISTORY_VERSION` instead of you need to check the current version of Simple History.

= 2.1.4 (July 2015) =

-   Fixed: WordPress core updates got the wrong previous version.
-   Updated: Updated German translations.
-   Added: GHU header added to plugin header, to support [GitHub Updater plugin](https://github.com/afragen/github-updater).

= 2.1.3 (July 2015) =

-   Fixed: Ajax error when loading a log that contained uploaded images.
-   Fixed: Removed some debug log messages.

= 2.1.2 (July 2015) =

-   Changed: By default the log now shows events from the last week, last two weeks or last 30 days, all depending on how many events you have in your log. The previous behavior was to not apply any filtering what so ever during the first load. Anyway: this change makes it possible to load the log very quickly even for very large logs. A large amount of users + keeping the log forever = millions of rows of data. Previously this could stall the log or make it load almost forever. Now = almost always very fast. I have tried it with over 5.000 users and a million row and yes - zing! - much faster. Fixes https://wordpress.org/support/topic/load-with-pagination-mysql.
-   Added: Finnish translation. Thanks a lot to the translator!
-   Updated: Swedish translation updated
-   Added: Cache is used on a few more places.
-   Added: Plugin now works as a ["must-use-plugin"](https://codex.wordpress.org/Must_Use_Plugins). Props [jacquesletesson](https://github.com/jacquesletesson).
-   Added: Filter `SimpleHistoryFilterDropin/show_more_filters_on_load` that is used to control if the search options should be expanded by default when the history page is loaded. Default is false, to have a less cluttered GUI.
-   Added: Filter `SimpleHistoryFilterDropin/filter_default_user_ids` that is used to search/filter specific user ids by default (no need to search and select users). Should fix https://wordpress.org/support/topic/how-to-pass-array-of-user-ids-to-history-query.
-   Added: Filter `SimpleHistoryFilterDropin/filter_default_loglevel` that is used to search/filter for log levels by default.
-   Fixed: if trying to log an array or an object the logger now automagically runs `json_encode()` on the value to make it a string. Previously is just tried to run `$wpdb->insert()` with the array and that gave errors. Should fix https://wordpress.org/support/topic/mysql_real_escape_string.
-   Fixed: The function that checks for new rows each second (or actually each tenth second to spare resources) was called an extra time each time the submit button for the filter was clicked. Kinda stupid. Kinda fixed now.
-   Fixed: The export feature that was added in version 2.1 was actually not enabled for all users. Now it is!
-   Fixed: Image attachments that is deleted from file system no longer result in "broken image" in the log. (Rare case, I know, but it does happen for me that local dev server and remote prod server gets out of "sync" when it comes to attachments.)

= 2.1.1 (May 2015) =

-   Removed: filter `simple_history/dropins_dir` removed.
-   Changed: Dropins are not loaded from a `glob()` call anymore (just like plugins in the prev release)
-   Updated: Brazilian Portuguese translation updated.
-   Fixed: POT file updated for translators.
-   Fixed: Better sanitization of API arguments.

= 2.1 (May 2015) =

-   Added: Export! Now it's possible to export the events log to a JSON or CSV formatted file. It's your data so you should be able to export it any time you want or need. And now you can do that. You will find the export function in the Simple History settings page (Settings -> Simple History).
-   Added: Filter `simple_history/add_custom_logger` and function `register_logger` that together are used to load external custom loggers. See [example-logger.php](https://github.com/bonny/WordPress-Simple-History/blob/master/examples/example-logger.php) for usage example.
-   Added: Filter `simple_history/header_initiator_use_you`.
-   Fixed: Fixed an undefined variable in get_avatar(). Fixes https://github.com/bonny/WordPress-Simple-History/issues/74.
-   Fixed: When using [HyperDB](https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/hyperdb) only one event was returned. Fixed by using [adding `NO_SELECT_FOUND_ROWS` to the query](https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/hyperdb/trunk/db.php?#L49). Should fix problems for users using HyperDB and also users using for example [wpengine.com](http://wpengine.com) (that probably also is using HyperDB or a similar approach).
-   Changed: Loggers now get default capability "manage_options" if they have no capability set.
-   Changed: Misc internal cleanup.
-   Removed: filter `simple_history/loggers_dir` removed, because loggers are loaded from array instead of file listing generated from `glob()`. Should be (however to the eye non-noticeable) faster.

= 2.0.30 (May 2015) =

-   Added: Username of logged events now link to that user's profile.
-   Fixed: When expanding occasions the first loaded occasion was the same event as the one you expanded from, and the last occasion was missing. Looked extra stupid when only 1 occasion existed, and you clicked "show occasions" only to just find the same event again. So stupid. But fixed now!
-   Fixed: If an event had many similar events the list of similar events could freeze the browser. ([17948 failed login attempts overnight](https://twitter.com/eskapism/status/595478847598002176) is not that uncommon it turns out!)
-   Fixed: Some loggers were missing the "All"-message in the search.
-   Changed: Hide some more keys and values by default in the context data popup.
-   Changed: Use `truncate` instead of `delete` when clearing the database. Works much faster on large logs.

= 2.0.29 (April 2015) =

-   Added: Introducing [Post "Quick Diff"](http://eskapism.se/blog/2015/04/quick-diff-shows-post-changes-in-wordpress/) ‚Äì a very simple and efficient way to quickly see what‚Äôs been changed in a post. With Quick Diff you will in a glance see the difference between the title, permalink, content, publish date, post status, post author, or the template of the post. It's really a super simple and fast way to follow the work of your co-editors.
-   Added: Filter to add custom HTML above and after the context data table. They are named `simple_history/log_html_output_details_single/html_before_context_table` and `simple_history/log_html_output_details_single/html_after_context_table` (and yes, I do fancy really long filter names).
-   Added: Filters to control what to output in the data/context details table (the popup you see when you click the time of each event): `simple_history/log_html_output_details_table/row_keys_to_show` and `simple_history/log_html_output_details_table/context_keys_to_show`. Also added [two usage examples](https://github.com/bonny/WordPress-Simple-History/blob/master/examples/examples.php) for the filters.
-   Added: Filter `simple_history/log_insert_context` to control what gets saved to the context table. Example on usage for this is also available in the [example file](https://github.com/bonny/WordPress-Simple-History/blob/master/examples/examples.php).
-   Added: data attribute `data-ip-address-multiple` and class `SimpleHistoryLogitem--IPAddress-multiple` added for events that have more than one IP address detected. Happens when `http_x_forwarded_for` or similar headers are included in response.
-   Updated: Danish translation updated.
-   Fixed: Images in GitHub readme files are now displayed correctly.
-   Fixed: Readme files to GitHub repositories ending with slash (/) now works correctly too.
-   Fixed: IP Info popup is now again closeable with `ESC` key or with a click outside it.
-   Fixed: Some enqueued scripts had double slashes in them.
-   Fixed: Make sure [URLs from add_query_arg() gets escaped](https://make.wordpress.org/plugins/2015/04/20/fixing-add_query_arg-and-remove_query_arg-usage/).
-   Fixed: Some other small things.

= 2.0.28 (April 2015) =

-   Fixed: Do not try to load the Translation Install API if using WordPress before 4.0. Fixes https://github.com/bonny/WordPress-Simple-History/issues/67.
-   Updated: German translation updated.

= 2.0.27 (April 2015) =

-   Fixed: Even better support for plugins from GitHub with the `GitHub Plugin URI` header. Plugin install, deactivations, and activations should have correct view-info-links now.
-   Updated: German translation updated.
-   Updated: Swedish translation updated.

= 2.0.26 (March 2015) =

-   Fixed: Plugin installs from wordpress.org would show "wordpress plugin directory" as their source file. Looked stupid. Fixed now!
-   Added: `composer.json` added, so Simple History can be pulled in to other projects via [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/). Actually untested, but at least the file is there. Please let me know if it works! :)

= 2.0.25 (March 2015) =

-   Added: Plugin installs now shows the source of the plugin. Supported sources are "WordPress plugin repository" and "uploaded ZIP archives".
-   Added: Plugin installs via upload now shows the uploaded file name.
-   Added: Support for showing plugin info-link for plugins from GitHub, installed with uploaded ZIP-archive. Only tested with a few plugins. Please let me know if it works or not!
-   Fixed: Messages for disabled loggers was not shown.
-   Fixed: An error when trying to show edit link for deleted comments.
-   Fixed: Use a safer way to get editable roles. Hopefully fixes https://wordpress.org/support/topic/php-warnings-simpleloggerphp-on-line-162.
-   Fixed: Some notice warnings from the comments logger.
-   Changed: Some other small things too.

= 2.0.24 (March 2015) =

-   Fixed: Plugin installs from uploaded ZIP files are now logged correctly. Fixes https://github.com/bonny/WordPress-Simple-History/issues/59.
-   Fixed: Check that JavaScript variables it set and that the object have properties set. Fixes https://wordpress.org/support/topic/firefox-37-js-error-generated-by-simplehistoryipinfodropinjs.
-   Updated: German translation updated.
-   Changed: Loading of loggers, dropins, and so one are moved from action `plugins_loaded` to `after_setup_theme` so themes can actually use for example the load*dropin*\*-filters...
-   Changed: Misc small design fixes.

= 2.0.23 (March 2015) =

-   Added: Filter `simple_history/rss_item_link`, so plugins can modify the link used in the RSS feed.
-   Added: Links for changed posts and attachments in RSS feed now links directly to WordPress admin, making is easier to follow things from your RSS reeder.
-   Added: Filters to hide history dashboard widget and history dashboard page. Filters are `simple_history/show_dashboard_widget` and `simple_history/show_dashboard_page`.
-   Fixed: A missing argument error when deleting a plugin. Fixes https://wordpress.org/support/topic/warning-missing-argument-1-for-simplepluginlogger.

= 2.0.22 (February 2015) =

-   Fixed: Deleted plugins were not logged correctly (name and other info was missing).
-   Added: Filter `simple_history/logger/load_logger` and `simple_history/dropin/load_dropin` that can be used to control the loading of each logger or dropin. See [example file](https://github.com/bonny/WordPress-Simple-History/blob/master/examples/examples.php) for usage examples.
-   Fixed: modal window with context data now works better on small screens.
-   Changed: Misc internal changes.

= 2.0.21 (February 2015) =

-   Added: Updates via XML RPC are now logged, for example when using the WordPress app for iOS or Android. Supported actions for now is post/page created, edited, deleted, and media uploads.
-   Added: `_xmlrpc_request` is added to context of event when an event is initiated through a XML-RPC all.
-   Changed: RSS feed now has loglevel of event prepended to the title.
-   Changed: Options logger now only shows the first 250 chars of new and old option values. Really long values could make the log look strange.
-   Added: If constant `SIMPLE_HISTORY_LOG_DEBUG` is defined and true automatically adds `$_GET`, `$_POST`, and more info to each logged event. Mostly useful for the developer, but maybe some of you are a bit paranoid and want it too.
-   Updated: German translation updated.

= 2.0.20 (February 2015) =

-   Added: changes via [WP-CLI](http://wp-cli.org) is now detected (was previously shown as "other").
-   Added: severity level (info, warning, debug, etc.) of event is includes in the RSS output.
-   Changed the way user login is logged. Should fix https://github.com/bonny/WordPress-Simple-History/issues/40 + possible more related issues.
-   Added: filter `simple_history/simple_logger/log_message_key` added, that can be used to shortcut log messages. See [example file](https://github.com/bonny/WordPress-Simple-History/blob/master/examples/examples.php) for usage. Fixes https://wordpress.org/support/topic/stop-logging-certain-types-of-activity.
-   Added: now uses object caching at some places. Should speed up some parts of the plugin for users with caching enabled.
-   Fixed: IP info popup can now be closed with `esc`.
-   Fixed: works better on small screens (like mobile phones) + misc other style related fixes.

= 2.0.19 (February 2015) =

-   Added: Dutch translation by [https://github.com/niknetniko](https://github.com/niknetniko). Thanks!
-   Changed: better compatibility with plugins like [WP User Avatar](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-user-avatar/).
-   Updated: German translation update.

= 2.0.18 (January 2015) =

-   Fixed: really correctly show the version number of the previous version!

= 2.0.17 (January 2015) =

-   Added: messages added using for example `SimpleLogger()->info( __("My log message") )` that have translations now auto translated the message back to english before storing the message (together with the text domain). Then upon retrieval it uses the english message + the text domain to translate the message to the currently selected language. This makes it easier to make multilingual log entries. (Yeah, I know its hard to understand what the heck this does, but it's something good and cool, trust me!)
-   Added: A sidebar with text contents on the history page.
-   Changed: Search now shows only the search box by default, with a link to show all search options.
-   Fixed: Search is now available at the dashboard again. Hooray!
-   Fixed: Old entries were not cleared automatically. Now it correctly removes old events, so your database will not risk growing to large.
-   Fixed: Quick stats could show two messages sometimes.
-   Fixed: When headers like `HTTP_X_FORWARDED_FOR` exists all valid IPs in that header is now stored.
-   Fixed: Plugin updates via third party software like [InfiniteWP](http://infinitewp.com/) should now correctly show the version number of the previous version.
-   Updated: German translation updated.
-   Notice: Do you read these messages? Then you must love this plugin! Come on then, [go and give it a nice review](https://wordpress.org/support/view/plugin-reviews/simple-history).

= 2.0.16 (January 2015) =

-   Fixed: Use the [X-Forwarded-For header](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-Forwarded-For), if it is set, to determine remote IP address. Should now correctly store IP addresses for servers behind load balancers or for clients going through proxies. Fixes https://wordpress.org/support/topic/use-x-forwarded-for-http-header-when-logging-remote_addr.
-   Changed: Failed login attempts from unknown and known users are now grouped together. This change was made because a hacker could make many login attempts to a site and rotate the logins, so they would try with both existing and non existing user names, which would make the log flood with failed login attempts.
-   Changed: use "n similar events" instead of "n more", to more clearly mark that the grouped events are not necessary exactly the same kind.
-   Changed: Quick stats text changed, to also include other sources. Previous behavior was to only include events from WordPress users, but now also events from anonymous users and WordPress (like from WP-Cron) are included.

= 2.0.13 (January 2015) =

-   Fixed: RSS feed is now valid according to http://validator.w3.org/. Fixes https://wordpress.org/support/topic/a-feed-which-was-valid-under-v206-is-no-longer-under-v209-latest.
-   Translation fixes. Thanks [ThomasDK81](https://github.com/ThomasDK81)!

= 2.0.8 (December 2014) =

-   Added: IP addresses can now be clicked to view IP address info from [ipinfo.io](http://ipinfo.io). This will get you the location and network of an IP address and help you determine from where for example a failed login attempt originates from.

-   Added: new action `simple_history/admin_footer`, to output HTML and JavaScript in footer on pages that belong to Simple History
-   Added: new trigger for JavaScript: `SimpleHistory:logReloadStart`. Fired when the log starts to reload, like when using the pagination or using the filter function.
-   Fixed: use Mustache-inspired template tags instead of Underscore default ones, because they don't work with PHP with asp_tags on.
-   Updated: Swedish translation updated

= 2.0.7 (December 2014) =

-   Fix: no message when restoring page from trash
-   Fix: use correct width for media attachment
-   Add: filter `simple_history/logrowhtmloutput/classes`, to modify HTML classes added to each log row item

= 2.0.6 (November 2014) =

-   Added: [WordPress 4.1 added the feature to log out a user from all their sessions](http://codex.wordpress.org/Version_4.1#Users). Simple History now logs when a user is logged out from all their sessions except the current browser, or if an admin destroys all sessions for a user. [View screenshot of new session logout log item](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/k4cmfmncekmfiib/2014-12-simple-history-changelog-user-sessions.png)

-   Uses WordPress own human_time_diff() instead of own version
-   Fix for time zones

-   Added POT-file

= 0.3.5 =

-   using get_the_title instead of fetching the title directly from the post object. should make plugins like qtranslate work a bit better.

-   the name of deleted items now show up, instead of "Unknown name" or similar
-   added support for plugins (who activated/deactivated what plugin)
-   support for third party history items. Use like this:
    simple_history_add("action=repaired&object_type=starship&object_name=USS Enterprise");
    this would result in something like this:
    Starship "USS Enterprise" repaired
    by admin (John Doe), just now
