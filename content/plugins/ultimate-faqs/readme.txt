### Get Set Up in No Time!

When you first activate the Ultimate FAQ plugin, it will automatically run a walk-through, which will help you create your FAQs and add them to a page.

### Google Optimized

The plugin includes full FAQPage and FAQ schema structured data markup, in LD+JSON format. So, when your page is indexed, Google will know itâ€™s an FAQ page and can list it accordingly in search results.

### Multiple Languages? We've got you covered!

Your FAQs are created using a post type. This means it works out of the box with language plugins like WPML, Loco Translate and Polylang. There are also many community translations already available [here](https://translate.wordpress.org/projects/wp-plugins/ultimate-faqs/). And, of course, we include an up-to-date .pot for good measure, in case you like to create your own custom translations for your FAQs.

### FAQ Customization Options

We've included (in the free version!) advanced customization features that let you choose what elements show for each FAQ (e.g. categories, tags, author, date, etc.), set the order of your FAQs and categories, fine tune accordion behavior, add your own custom CSS and more!

### FAQ Statistics

Statistics and view counts are automatically enabled, so you can easily keep track of which FAQs are the most popular.

### FAQ Comments

We've included the ability for you to enable comments on FAQs, giving you a platform to communicate with your users/customers and help improve not only your knowledge base, but your overall product or service. The FAQ comments make use of WordPress's built-in comment engine, which means seamless integration and you can use WordPress's comment and moderation settings to fine tune the experience.

### Use AI to Generate FAQs

You no longer need to manually create all your FAQs. Let the plugin do the heavy lifting for you! We now offer Open AI integration, via which the plugin will automatically generate new FAQs for you. You just need to specify which page or post should be used and the plugin will automatically create the FAQ based on the content of it. You can also choose to automatically assign an FAQ to a category. You then get a chance to review the generated content before publishing it to your site. 

#### Premium AI-generated FAQs

In the premium version you will get access to create up to 20 AI-generated FAQs at a time as well as to specify multiple pages and/or posts from which the content should be pulled to generate the FAQs.

*Privacy note: The plugin sends post or page content to our server, which is forwarded to Open AI when using the AI FAQ generation feature. No other data is sent to external sources.*

### Powerful FAQ Search (Requires Premium)

- Add the FAQ search form anywhere on your site via block, pattern or shortcode.
- It uses asynchronous requests to search your whole database of FAQs in real time, without having to reload the page. 
- It comes with an option to display your FAQs on page load, so you can use one block for everything. No duplicates. No mess. Super easy for your users!

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Is there a Gutenberg block to display FAQs? =

Yes, you can search for the **Display FAQs** block. Alternatively, you'll find it in its own block category/section called **Ultimate FAQs**. 

For a complete list of FAQ blocks and their associated parameters, please see [here](https://doc.etoilewebdesign.com/plugins/ultimate-faq/user/blocks-shortcodes/).

= Is there a shortcode to display FAQs? =

Yes, you can use the `[ultimate-faqs]` shortcode. 

For a complete list of FAQ shortcodes and their associated attributes, please see [here](https://doc.etoilewebdesign.com/plugins/ultimate-faq/user/blocks-shortcodes/).

= Can I have multiple FAQ pages with different FAQs on each =

Yes. For this, we would recommend assigning your FAQs to different categories and then using the FAQ shortcode to include only the category you want on each page. For more info, see [here](https://doc.etoilewebdesign.com/plugins/ultimate-faq/user/blocks-shortcodes/ultimate-faqs-shortcode).

= How do I sort the order of my FAQs? =

The FAQ order can be sorted by title, created date or modified date. The categories can be sorted by name, slug or count. If you are using the premium version, there is also a drag-and-drop table that can be used for precise FAQ ordering. For more info, see [here](https://doc.etoilewebdesign.com/plugins/ultimate-faq/user/faqs/order).

= Can I translate my FAQs? =

Yes, the Ultimate FAQ plugin uses a custom post type and all of the strings/labels are localized in the code. For more information on plugin translation, please see [here](https://doc.etoilewebdesign.com/plugins/ultimate-faq/user/labelling/translating).

= Is the Ultimate FAQ plugin compatible with WPML? =

Yes, it uses a custom post type and taxonomies. As such, if you enable our post type in the WPML settings, you'll be able to create translations of your FAQs, categories and tags. As well, all the strings/labels are localized in the code. As such, they will be picked up by WPML's String Translation tool for easy direct translating. 

For more info on translating FAQs, please see [here](https://doc.etoilewebdesign.com/plugins/ultimate-faq/user/labelling/translating).

= The individual FAQ page isn't displaying correctly =

For the FAQ single post pages, it would be your theme that controls the look and layout. Because the FAQs are a custom post type, the single post page for FAQ posts would, by default, make use of your theme's single.php template file. If you'd like to modify the single post page for FAQs, we'd suggest duplicating your single.php file and creating one specifically for our post type, as discussed [here](https://codex.wordpress.org/Post_Type_Templates). Our post type is called **ufaq**, so you'd want to call your template file **single-ufaq.php**.

= How can I make my FAQs sharable over social media? =

On the premium FAQ settings page you can choose to link to twitter, facebook and more!

= How do I make my FAQs searchable? =

You can use the premium shortcode [ultimate-faq-search] or the premium "FAQ Search block", which displays an AJAX FAQ search form. You can use the "Auto-Complete Titles" option to have a list of all matching questions pop up when a user has typed 3 or more characters into the FAQ search field.

= How do I add FAQs to a WooCommerce product page? =

In the premium version, you can add FAQs for either a specific product or for a WooCommerce category.

For a specific product, create an FAQ category with the same name as the product, and then select that category for all of the FAQs you want included on your product page.

For a category of WooCommerce products, create an FAQ category with the same name as the WooCommerce category, and then select that category for all of the FAQs you want included on your product page.

= How do I customize my FAQs, for example, to change the font? =

You can customize the plugin by adding code to the Custom CSS box on the FAQ settings page.

You can also use the "Styling" area of the "Options" tab if you're on the premium version, which has a built-in color picker for FAQ fields and more!
